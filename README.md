# SlugPlayer
Basic MP3 Player with a GUI from pythonprogramming, right now I'm just trying to make it a normal MP3 player but I will code a bit more to practice coding one of the problems on the question bank from one of my CS classes :) 

Must have VLC Player installed, the vlc python module, SIP/PyQT5 module in order to run + a songs folder wherever you put the python files with some audio files in order to run
